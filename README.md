### Template Implementation Principles

1. **🏗️ Feature-Based Architecture**: Each feature module is self-contained with clear boundaries and responsibilities
2. **📦 Clean Architecture**: Strict separation of concerns across Presentation, Domain, and Data layers
3. **🔧 Code Generation Integration**: Automated generation of models, providers, and serialization code
4. **📚 Documentation System**: Memory-bank approach for maintaining project context and institutional knowledge
5. **🧪 Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test coverage across unit, widget, integration, and performance dimensions
6. **📱 Cross-Platform Optimization**: Platform-specific configurations and optimizations for Android/iOS deployment

This structure template ensures maintainability, scalability, and consistency across Flutter projects.


## 🤖 Robot AI System

### Architecture
The robot AI system uses a **Strategy Pattern** for clean, maintainable code:

- **`RobotConfig`**: Configuration class with difficulty settings
- **`RobotService`**: Main service that coordinates AI decisions
- **`RobotStrategy`**: Interface for different AI behaviors
- **Strategy Implementations**:
  - `EasyRobotStrategy`: Random moves with basic blocking
  - `MediumRobotStrategy`: Strategic play with pattern recognition
  - `HardRobotStrategy`: Advanced tactics with lookahead

### Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: Random moves, occasionally blocks obvious wins
- **Medium**: Strategic positioning, blocks wins, creates threats
- **Hard**: Advanced tactics, multiple move lookahead, optimal play

### Configuration
```dart
// Easy robot
final easyConfig = RobotConfig.forDifficulty(Difficulty.easy);

// Medium robot with custom settings
final mediumConfig = RobotConfig(
  difficulty: Difficulty.medium,
  thinkTime: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  useHints: true,
);

// Hard robot
final hardConfig = RobotConfig.forDifficulty(Difficulty.hard);
```

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Electric Azure (#2DD4FF) - Main accent color for interactive elements
- **Secondary**: Vivid Magenta (#F43F9D) - Secondary accent for highlights
- **Tertiary**: Lime Pulse (#A3E635) - Success and positive feedback states
- **Neutral**: Deep space grays with WCAG-compliant contrast ratios
- **Semantic**: Success, warning, error, and info colors with proper accessibility

### Typography Scale
- **Display/Headings**: Sora Variable (600 weight) - Modern, readable headlines
- **UI/Body**: Inter Variable (500 weight) - Clean, legible body text
- **Numeric**: JetBrains Mono (700 weight) - Monospace for scores and data
- **System Integration**: Automatic text scaling support for accessibility

### Responsive Design System
- **Custom Implementation**: 244+ responsive extension methods via BuildContext
- **8 Comprehensive Mixins**: Card, Button, Spacing, Layout, Text, Icon, Container, AppBar
- **Type-Safe API**: Compile-time detection of responsive issues
- **Performance Optimized**: <10% overhead with cached calculations
- **Breakpoint System**: 600px (phone) and 900px (tablet) breakpoints

### Motion Design
- **Micro**: 120ms for subtle interactions and feedback
- **Standard**: 240ms for typical animations and transitions
- **Emphasized**: 400ms for celebratory effects and state changes
- **Celebration**: 1200ms for win states with confetti and particles
- **Easing**: Custom cubic-bezier curves for natural, fluid motion
- **Animation Pooling**: Memory-efficient animation controller management

## 🔧 Shared Components System

import 'package:tictactoe_xo_royale/shared/widgets/cards/enhanced_card.dart';
import 'package:tictactoe_xo_royale/shared/widgets/buttons/enhanced_button.dart';

// Usage - explicit access to specific components
EnhancedCard(...)         // Card component
EnhancedButton(...)       // Button component
// 244+ responsive methods available via mixin extensions
```

### Migration Guidelines
1. **Analyze Current Implementation**: Review existing patterns and identify reusable components
2. **Map to Shared Widgets**: Identify which shared widget best fits the current implementation
3. **Preserve Visual Consistency**: Ensure 100% visual consistency with existing design
4. **Update Imports**: Replace feature-specific imports with shared widget imports
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate responsive behavior, accessibility, and performance
6. **Remove Duplicate Code**: Clean up original implementations after migration

- **X/O Mark Animations**: Smooth drawing animations with AnimationController
- **Winning Line Effects**: Neon sweep effects with custom painting
- **Particle Systems**: Confetti and celebration effects
- **Touch Input Handling**: Direct canvas interaction for game controls

### Flutter Widgets (UI Structure)
- **Screen Layouts**: Scaffold, AppBar, and navigation structure
- **Form Controls**: Text fields, buttons, and input validation
- **Lists and Grids**: Game history, achievements, and store items
- **Overlays and Dialogs**: Popups, modals, and game state displays
- **Responsive Layouts**: Adaptive sizing for different screen sizes

### Material 3 (Design System)
- **Component Theming**: Cards, buttons, and form controls
- **Color Schemes**: Light/dark mode with semantic color tokens
- **Typography**: Consistent text styles and scaling
- **Motion**: Standardized animation durations and easing
- **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility features and contrast ratios

## 📱 Performance Considerations

### Frame Rate Targets

- **Target**: 120-144 FPS on supported devices (8.33ms-6.94ms frame budget)
- **Game Rendering**: ≤8ms per frame for board rendering and animations

### Optimization Strategies
- **CustomPainter Rendering**: High-performance Canvas-based game board with cached Paint objects
- **RepaintBoundary**: Isolate expensive painting operations for game visuals
- **Animation Pooling**: Limit concurrent AnimationControllers with shared resource pool
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of controllers, streams, and animations in dispose()
- **Provider Optimization**: Selective rebuilds using `.select()` and `updateShouldNotify`
- **Asset Preloading**: Audio and visual assets loaded during app initialization
- **Code Generation**: Reduced runtime reflection with generated immutable models

### Platform-Specific Optimizations
- **Android**: Custom responsive system optimized for various GPU capabilities and screen densities
- **iOS**: Leverages Metal rendering engine with platform-specific haptic patterns
- **Cross-Platform**: Unified responsive API that adapts to platform conventions
