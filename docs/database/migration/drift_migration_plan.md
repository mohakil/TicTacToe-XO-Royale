# Comprehensive Drift Migration Plan for Tic Tac Toe XO Royale

## Implementation Rules & Execution Guidelines

### Strict Sequential Task Execution Rule
**MANDATORY**: All tasks and subtasks MUST be executed sequentially, one at a time, without exception.

1. **Single Task Focus**: At any given time, work on ONLY ONE task or subtask from the checklist.
2. **Completion Before Progression**: A task/subtask is not considered complete until:
   - All code changes are implemented and tested
   - The corresponding checklist item is marked as completed: `[x] Task description`
   - Any required deliverables are documented or created
3. **No Parallel Work**: Do not start the next task until the current one is fully completed and checked off.
4. **Atomic Commits**: Each task should result in a single, coherent commit or set of changes that can be reviewed independently.
5. **Verification Step**: After completing each task, run relevant tests and verify functionality before marking as complete.
6. **Documentation Update**: Update this plan document immediately after completing each task to reflect current progress.
7. **Issue Resolution Priority**: Before marking a task as complete, fix all existing issues, warnings, and errors related to the current task.
8. **User Confirmation Required**: After completing a task and updating the plan, STOP work and ask the user for confirmation before proceeding to the next task.
9. **Rollback Awareness**: If a task introduces issues, stop immediately and address them before proceeding.

**Violation of this rule will result in halting the entire migration process until corrected.**

## Overview
This plan outlines a complete migration from `shared_preferences` to Drift database across the entire codebase. The migration will be done incrementally to minimize risk while ensuring all data persistence is handled by Drift.

## Current State Analysis

### Storage Architecture
- **Current Storage**: `shared_preferences` for all data persistence (profiles, settings, achievements, theme, store)
- **Main Entities**: `PlayerProfile`, `PlayerStats`, `GameHistory`, `Achievements`, `AppSettings`, `ThemeMode`, `StoreItems`, `GameConfig`
- **Data Volume**: Moderate (user profiles, game history, achievements, settings)

### Existing Riverpod Integration
- Well-structured providers with `keepAlive: true` where needed
- Proper disposal patterns with `_mounted` flags
- Extension methods for easy provider access (`ProfileProviderExtension`, etc.)
- Computed providers using `select` for granular rebuilds
- Existing code generation setup with `freezed`, `json_serializable`, `riverpod_generator`

### Data Flow Patterns
- **Profile Provider**: Manages user data, gems, hints, stats, and game history
- **Settings Provider**: Handles audio, haptic, and app preferences
- **Theme Provider**: Manages theme mode selection
- **Achievement Provider**: Tracks unlocked achievements and progress
- **Store Provider**: Manages in-app purchases and inventory

- ✅ Deployment and maintenance guides (migration complete)
- ✅ Final code review checklist (all artifacts cleaned)

**Estimated Time:** 1 day (completed)

## Risk Mitigation & Rollback Plan

### Risk Assessment:
- **High Risk**: Data loss during migration (mitigate with backups and phased rollout)
- **Medium Risk**: Performance degradation (mitigate with benchmarking and optimization)
- **Low Risk**: Provider API changes (mitigate with backward compatibility)

### Rollback Strategy:
1. **Phase-by-Phase Rollback**: Can revert individual phases if issues arise
2. **Data Backup**: Keep shared_preferences data until migration is verified in production
3. **Feature Flags**: Implement toggles to switch between old/new implementations during rollout
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy with Drift disabled initially, enable via remote configuration

### Mitigation Measures:
- **Backups**: Maintain complete backups of shared_preferences data
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before each phase deployment
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of database performance and errors
- **Rollback Scripts**: Automated scripts to revert to shared_preferences if needed

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] All existing features work identically after migration
- [ ] Data persists correctly across app restarts and device reboots
- [ ] No data loss during migration process
- [ ] All existing tests pass with new implementation

### Performance Requirements:
- [ ] Database read operations < 50ms for simple queries
- [ ] Database write operations < 100ms for complex transactions
- [ ] UI updates remain smooth (no jank from database operations)
- [ ] Memory usage within 20% of current baseline
- [ ] App startup time not increased by more than 100ms

### Quality Requirements:
- [ ] 100% test coverage for new database code
- [ ] Proper error handling for all database operations (no crashes)
- [ ] Type-safe queries throughout the application
- [ ] Proper disposal of database resources and subscriptions
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for database schema and operations

## Next Steps After Approval

1. **Begin Phase 1**: Set up dependencies and design database schema
2. **Weekly Check-ins**: Review progress and adjust plan as needed
3. **Testing Gates**: Ensure each phase passes comprehensive tests before proceeding
4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep this plan updated with actual progress and findings

## Approval

**Plan Status**: ⏳ Awaiting Approval

Once approved, implementation will begin immediately with Phase 1. All phases will be implemented and tested sequentially to ensure stability and minimize risk.

*This plan is designed to be comprehensive yet flexible. If any phase encounters unexpected challenges, we can adjust the approach while maintaining the overall migration goals.*
