- **Stats Management**: Dual stats system (session vs lifetime) requires careful state management and smart reset logic
- **Game History Design**: History UI should focus on essential info (opponent, result, score) without time complexity for better UX
- **View All Pattern**: Progressive disclosure (show 3 initially, view all for complete history) improves performance and UX
- **Achievement Initialization**: Database initialization must include ALL achievements (20 total) when profiles are created, not just a subset
- **Profile-Provider Sync**: Achievement provider must use correct profile IDs to load achievements from database properly
- **Code Quality**: Regular Flutter analyze runs catch issues early and maintain production-ready code quality
- **Migration Testing**: Comprehensive testing (50+ test cases) ensures robust data migration with error handling
- **Provider Architecture**: Riverpod 3.0 provides excellent foundation for migrating state management to database operations
- **ProfileProvider Drift Migration**: Successful migration demonstrates clean separation of concerns, proper error handling, and reactive data flow with Drift database operations
- **Unit Testing Strategy**: 163 comprehensive unit tests across all DAOs validates database operations, edge cases, error scenarios, and reactive streams for bulletproof reliability
- **Test-Driven Migration**: Sequential testing approach catches issues early, ensures data integrity, and validates each migration phase before proceeding

This project demonstrates modern Flutter development with clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and excellent user experience. The responsive system implementation is particularly noteworthy as a custom solution that provides better control and performance than external packages.
